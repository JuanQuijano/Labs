## Lab 4 - Implement Azure Functions ##
In this walkthrough, we will create a Function App to display a Hello message when there is an HTTP request.

# Task 1: Create a Function app #
In this task, we will create a Function app.

Open your choice of web browser and sign in to the Azure portal by navigating to https://portal.azure.com and entering the following Azure Credentials:

    * Username: alumnoXX@juanquijanodemos.onmicrosoft.com
    * Password: AzurePa55w0rd

On Stay signed in? select Yes.

In the Search resources, services, and docs text box at the top of the portal, search for and select Function App and then, from the Function App blade, click + Create. Accept the default option (Consumption) and click Select.

On the Basic tab of the Function App blade, specify the following settings (replace xxxx in the name of the function with letters and digits such that the name is globally unique and leave all other settings with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Subscription | Aula01 |
    | Resource Group | RGalumnoXX |
    | Function App name | functionalumnoXX |
    | Runtime stack | .NET |
    | Version | 6 (LTS) isolated worker model |
    | Region | Spain Central |

Click Review + Create and, after successful validation, click Create to begin provisioning and deploying your new Azure Function App.

Wait for the notification that the resource has been created.

Navigate back to the Function App blade, click Refresh and verify that the newly created function app has the Running status.

## Task 2: Create a HTTP triggered function and test ##
In this task, we will use the Webhook + API function to display a message when there is an HTTP request.

Important: Due to changes in Azure, please complete the following steps:

On the Function app blade, in the Settings section, select Environment Variables and under App settings, select FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME.

Change the Value from dotnet-isolated to dotnet, select Apply > Apply and then Confirm.

On the function app blade, in the Overview section, scroll down to Functions and then click Create function under Create in Azure portal.

A Create function pop-up window will appear on the right. In the Select a template section click HTTP trigger. Click Next, then select Create.

On the HttpTrigger1 | Code + Test blade, review the auto-generated code and note that the code is designed to run an HTTP request and log information. Also, notice the function returns a Hello message with a name.

Click Get function URL from the top section of function editor.

Copy the default (Function key) URL.

Open a new browser tab and paste the copied function URL into your web browser's address bar. When the page is requested the function will run. Notice the returned message stating that the function requires a name in the request body.

Screenshot

Append &name=yourname to the end of the URL.

Note: For example, if your name is Cindy, the final URL will resemble the following: https://azfuncxxx.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger1?code=X9xx9999xXXXXX9x9xxxXX==&name=cindy

When you hit enter, your function runs and every invocation is traced. You will recieve a message similar to the following: "Hello, Cindy. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.".

To view the traces, you would normally return to the HttpTrigger1 | Code + Test blade and click Logs.

However, this requires configuration of application insights and for the purpose of this lab, we will not be exploring these features just yet. Futher information on monitoring function apps can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/configure-monitoring?tabs=v2.

Congratulations! You have created a Function App to display a Hello message when there is an HTTP request.
