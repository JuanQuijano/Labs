# Create blob storage #
In this walkthrough, we will create a storage account, then work with blob storage files.

## Task 1: Create a storage account ##
Open your choice of web browser and sign in to the Azure portal by navigating to https://portal.azure.com and entering the following Azure Credentials:

    * Username: alumnoXX@juanquijanodemos.onmicrosoft.com
    * Password: AzurePa55w0rd1234

On Stay signed in? select Yes.

From the All services blade, search for and select Storage accounts, and then click + Create.

On the Basics tab of the Create storage account blade, fill in the following information (replace xxxx in the name of the storage account with letters and digits such that the name is globally unique). Leave the defaults for everything else.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Subscription | Aula01 |
    | Resource Group | RGalumnoXX |
    | Function App name | storageaccalumnoXX |
    | Region | Spain Central |

In Advanced Tab, select the check of *Allow enabling anonymous access on individual containers*

Click Review + create to review your storage account settings and allow Azure to validate the configuration.

Once validated, click Create. Wait for the notification that the account was successfully created.

From the Home page, search for and select Storage accounts and ensure your new storage account is listed.

## Task 2: Work with blob storage ##
In this task, we will create a Blob container and upload a blob file.

Click the name of the new storage account, scroll to the Data Storage section, and then click Containers.

Click + Container and configure using the following information then click Create. Use the Information icons to learn more. When done click OK.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Name | container1 |
    | Public access level | Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs) |

Click the container1 container, and then click Upload.

Browse to a file on your local machine

Note: If you are unable to find a file, You can create an empty .txt file or use any existing file. Consider choosing a file of a small size to minimize the upload time.

Click the Advanced arrow, leave the default values but review the available options, and then click Upload.

Note: You can upload as many blobs as you like in this way. New blobs will be listed within the container.

Once the file is uploaded, right-click on the file and copy the URL.

Open a new tab in your navigator, and paste the Url. See the image.

If you change el Change access level to Private (no anonymous access), you cant see the image. An error is returned.

As you have time, from the storage account blade, review the options for Files, Tables, and Queues.

## Task 3: Monitor the storage account ##
If needed, return to the storage account blade and click Diagnose and solve problems.

Explore some of the most common storage problems. Notice there are multiple troubleshooter.

On the storage account blade, scroll down to the Monitoring section and click Insights. Notice there is information on Failures, Performance, Availability, and Capacity. Your information will be different.
