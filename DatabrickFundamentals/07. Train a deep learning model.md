# Train a deep learning model #
In this exercise, you'll explore techniques for preparing data and training machine learning models in Azure Databricks.

## Task 1: Import and explore a notebook ##
In this exercise, you'll use code in a notebook to explore Spark ML in Azure Databricks.

The tasks and code used in this exercise are in a notebook that you will run in your cluster.

In the Azure Databricks portal for your workspace, in the sidebar on the left, select **Workspace**. Then select the **⌂ Home** folder.

At the top of the page, in the **⋮** menu next to your user name, select **Import**. Then in the Import dialog box, select URL and import the notebook from https://github.com/JuanQuijano/Labs/blob/main/DatabrickFundamentals/resources/Deep-learning.ipynb

Connect the notebook to your cluster, and follow the instructions it contains; running its code cells to explore Spark ML.

    It is very important that you read all the instructions and explanations of what you are going to do.
