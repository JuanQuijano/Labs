* Leave the remaining values on the defaults and then click the Review + create button at the bottom of the page.

Once Validation is passed click the Create button. It can take anywhere from five to seven minutes to deploy the virtual machine.

You will receive updates on the deployment page and via the Notifications area (the bell icon in the top menu bar).

### Task 2: Connect to the virtual machine ###
In this task, we will connect to our new virtual machine using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

Click on bell icon from the upper blue toolbar, and select 'Go to resource' when your deployment has succeded.

*Note: You could also use the Go to resource link on the deployment page*

On the Overview blade, select the Connect dropdown and then select Connect.

*Note: The following directions tell you how to connect to your VM from a Windows computer. On a Mac, you need an RDP client such as this Remote Desktop Client from the Mac App Store and on a Linux computer you can use an open source RDP client.*

On the myVM | Connect page, keep the default options to connect with the public IP address over port 3389 and click Download RDP File under Native RDP. A file will download on the top right of your screen. If you get a warning message, select Keep from the top right of the screen.

Open the downloaded RDP file (located on the top right of the browser) by selecting Open file and click Connect when prompted.

In the Windows Security window, sign in using the Admin Credentials you used when creating your VM Administrador and the password Pa55w0rd1234! and then click OK.

You may receive a warning certificate during the sign-in process. Click Yes or to create the connection and connect to your deployed VM. You should connect successfully.

A new Virtual Machine (myVM) will launch inside your Lab. Close the Server Manager and dashboard windows that pop up (click "x" at top right). You should see the blue background of your virtual machine. 

<b>Congratulations! You have deployed and connected to a Virtual Machine running Windows Server.</b>

### Task 3: Install the web server role and test ###

In this task, install the Web Server role on the server on the Virtual Machine you just created and ensure the default IIS welcome page will be displayed.


In the newly opened virtual machine, launch PowerShell by searching PowerShell in the search bar, when found right click Windows PowerShell to Run as administrator.

In PowerShell, install the Web-Server feature on the virtual machine by running the following command. (Paste in the command and hit ENTER for the installment to begin).

<code>Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools</code>

When completed, a prompt will state Success with a value True. You do not need to restart the virtual machine to complete the installation. 

Close the RDP connection to the VM by clicking the x on the blue bar at the top center of your virtual machine and click OK. You can also minimize it by clicking the - on the blue bar at the top center.

Back in the portal, navigate back to the Overview blade of myVM and under the Essentials section copy the Public IP address of myVM by using the Click to clipboard button

Open a new browser tab, paste the public IP address into the URL text box, and press the Enter key to browse to it.

The default IIS Web Server welcome page will be displayed.

> <b>Congratulations! You have created a new VM running a web server that is accessible via its public IP address.</b> If you had a web application to host, you could deploy application files to the virtual machine and host them for public access on the deployed virtual machine.
