# Create a Web App #
## Scenario ##

In this walkthrough, we will create a new web app that runs a NGINX web server default site.

## Task 1: Create a Web App ##
Azure App Service is actually a collection of four services, all of which are built to help you host and run web applications. The four services (Web Apps, Static Apps, Container Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps, Functions, and Logic Apps) look different, but in the end they all operate in very similar ways. Web Apps are the most commonly used of the four services, and this is the service that we will be using in this lab.

In this task, you will create an Azure App Service Web App.

Open your choice of web browser and sign in to the Azure portal by navigating to https://portal.azure.com and entering the following Azure Credentials:

    * Username: alumnoXX@juanquijanodemos.onmicrosoft.com
    * Password: AzurePa55w0rd1234
On Stay signed in? select Yes.

From the All services blade, search for and select App Services. Click + Create and choose Web App.

On the Basics tab of the Web App blade, specify the following settings (replace xxxx in the name of the web app with letters and digits such that the name is globally unique). Leave the defaults for everything else, including the App Service Plan.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Subscription | Aula01 |
    | Resource Group | RGalumnoXX |
    | Name | myDockerWebAppxxxx |
    | Publish | Container |
    | Operating System | Linux |
    | Region | Spain Central |
    | Linux Plan | Create new (named "AppPlan") |
    | Pricing plan | Premium V3 P0V3 |

Click the Container tab and configure the container information. The startup command is optional and not needed in this exercise.

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | Image Source | Quickstart |
    | Sample | NGINX |

Click Review + create, and then click Create.

## Task 2: Test the Web App ##
In this task, we will test the web app.

Wait for the Web App to deploy.

From Notifications click Go to resource.

On the Overview blade, locate the URL or Default domain. Copy the URL to the clipboard.

Click on the URL to open the new browser tab and display the Hey, App Service developers page.

Switch back to the Overview blade of your web app and note that it includes several charts. If you repeat step 4 a few times, you should be able to see correspoding telemetry being displayed in the charts. This includes number of requests and average response time.

Congratultions! You successfully created an Azure App Service.
